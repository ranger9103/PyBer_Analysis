# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
-V. Isualize would like to evaluate the weekly data of PyBer comparing city types to be used by decision makers of PyBer.

## Results
-Ride sharing is largely used in the urban areas. There are many more overall fares which is not unexpected considering the population density of urban areas versus suburban and rural areas. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are highest in the rural areas. This makes sense related to the geography of rural and suburban areas compared to urban. 

## Summary
1. Business growth in new urban markets has the potential for a high number of fares.
2. Suburban and rural areas have higher margins per ride and have potential for growth as well, although more market research may be needed to chose the best options for emerging markets.
3. For suburban and rural areas, recruiting new drivers has the potential for higher per fare profits for the driver. This can be used as a strategy to entice more partners in those areas.
